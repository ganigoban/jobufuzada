After this initial watering, avoid watering your lawn for a couple days so the nutrients can settle in. Then, return to your regular lawn-watering schedule, and remember these tips: <b>Don't water every day</b>.</span></span> <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on lawnbuddies.com</a><h2>How often should I water after fertilizing?</h2>In fact, you can wait for as much as 12-24 hours to water your plants again for the best results. However, be sure that after 24 hours, you resume your normal watering schedule. Otherwise, your plants might not be able to get the water they need to fully benefit from that fertilizer. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on terra-lawn-care.com</a><h2>Can I fertilize my lawn every 2 weeks?</h2>Can I fertilize my lawn every 2 weeks? To avoid over-fertilizing, applying a fertilizer every two weeks is not recommended. Fertilizing as often as every two weeks will likely lead to problems such as lawn burn, excessive grass growth, as well as polluted water that can lead to toxic algae growth. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on theturfgrassgroup.com</a><h2>Is it OK if it rains after you fertilize?</h2>On the positive side, the rain can help the fertilizer soak into the soil, providing essential nutrients to the grass. However, if the rain is too heavy, it can lead to runoff, causing the fertilizer to be washed away before it has a chance to benefit the lawn. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Is morning dew enough to water in fertilizer?</h2>Despite it falling, you should fertilize your lawn early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the high midday temperature.

But it is important to make sure that it does receive a good watering session soon after that 24 hour waiting period.

In ideal conditions, some of the fertilizer can be taken up by the plants within a few hours, while the full effects may be seen within a few days to a couple of weeks. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Should I mow before fertilizing?</h2>Ideally, you'll want to mow and rake before fertilizing, so that excess lawn waste is removed and the fertilizer will have an easier time reaching the soil. Aerating your soil before fertilizing can also help; the best times to aerate are when your grass is actively growing, such as in spring or early fall. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on scotts.com</a><h2>What is the best lawn fertilizer schedule?</h2>When to Fertilize Your Lawn.

After the 24 hours are up, it's important to give it a good soak—not just a quick spritz with your hose—to activate the fertilizer and help the critical nutrients absorb into the soil. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on greenlawnfertilizing.com</a><h2>How long should you stay off grass after fertilizing?</h2>It's generally recommended to wait about 24-72 hours after a fertilizer application before letting your kids go back onto the grass and to also ensure your lawn is watered well before the kids go back to playing in the grass. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on gatsbygrounds.com</a><h2>How long does it take granular fertilizer to work?</h2>If you use a quick-release fertilizer on your lawn, results may be seen within a 24- to 48-hour period and will last two to four weeks.

Too much fertilizer adds too much nitrogen and salt to the soil.
