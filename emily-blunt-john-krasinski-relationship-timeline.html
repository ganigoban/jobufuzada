It was love at first sight, he said — really.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was one of those things where I wasn't really looking for a relationship and I was thinking I'm going to take my time in L.A.," he said. "Then, I met her and I was so nervous. I was like, 'Oh god, I think I'm going to fall in love with her.' As I shook her hand, I went, 'I like you.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Blunt said that her reaction wasn't all that different.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were discussing how much I was enjoying being single.

"I think that I was so sure that I would never end up with her ... that I was like, 'You know what, I'm gonna blow it right away and then that way you don't feel bad.'"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>August 2009</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blunt and Krasinski <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">got engaged</a> less than a year after they met.

"Then, I think people weren't really sure what was going on, but they were crying because we were crying. But it was great. At the end of the day, she said yes, which is great.

"I look at the pictures and it just has an orange hue that is unnatural to normal skin color. Why was I on a budget on my wedding day? It was a bit patchy. It stinks! And it was a very hot day, so if you sweat and you have a spray tan — wearing white. Just seeping orange.
