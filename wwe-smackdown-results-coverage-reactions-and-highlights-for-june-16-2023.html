The teams that will be in the match tonight are: Pretty Deadly, The Street Profits, LWO, The Brawling Brutes, Hit Row and Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson.</p><p>SmackDown tonight will also feature an appearance from Roman Reigns as the drama within the Bloodline continues.</p><p>It should be interesting to see how things play out on tonight’s show.</p><p>SmackDown kicks off with a video package that shows the story so far of The Usos falling out of favor with Roman Reigns, including Jey Uso’s unsuccessful United States Championship match last week.</p><p>We then cut to Kayla Braxton in the parking lot as a car arrives that Roman Reigns, Solo Sikoa and Paul Heyman get out off. Braxton asks Heyman where Jey Uso stands in the Bloodline, Heyman sighs and does not provide an answer before leaving the area.</p><p>Tag Team Gauntlet Match</p><p>The match kicks off with our first two teams in the ring being The Street Profits and Sheamus and Ridge Holland of The Brawling Brutes. The bell rings and Sheamus and Ford start in the ring. Sheamus hits a shoulder tackle and Ford pops up and hits a drop kick. Ford hits a chop that Sheamus no-sells before hitting a back breaker and tagging Holland in. Holland hits a vertical suplex and Ford avoids another suplex and hits an enziguri before tagging Dawkins in. Dawkins hits the corkscrew elbow splash. Sheamus tags himself in and while Dawkins doesn’t see the tag Sheamus hits a brogue kick and pins Dawkins to eliminate The Street Profits.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Gallows and Anderson are the next team up as they get in the ring and we cut to commercial.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>The gauntlet match continues live with Gallows having Sheamus in a headlock. Gallows hits a power slam and covers for two. Anderson tags in and hits a series of strong right hand strikes before covering Sheamus for two. Gallows tags back in and hits Sheamus with a vertical suplex. Sheamus avoids a big boot and hits a body slam. Sheamus crawls to the corner but Anderson tags in and knocks Holland off the ramp. Anderson turns around into a brogue kick and Sheamus covers for three to advance.</p><p>Our next team is LWO. Wilde and Del Toro get in the ring and hit a double drop kick before following with double dives outside. Wilde hits a missile drop kick to Sheamus and Del Toro tags in and hits a moonsault and covers Sheamus for two. Sheamus makes the tag to Holland who hits a big belly to belly throw. Holland plants Del Toro with a face buster and covers for the three.</p><p>Next up is Hit Row, Top Dolla gets in the ring and is immediately hit with a brogue kick and covered for three….moving on.</p><p>The match comes down to The brawling Brutes and Pretty Deadly as we cut to commercial.</p><p>*commercial break*</p><p>Back live with Elton Prince driving Holland into the corner, Prince hits an Irish whip to cause Holland to crash hard into the turnbuckle. Prince locks in a sleeper hold on the mat. Holland stays in the hold for a long time before powering to his feet and breaking free with elbow strikes. Prince tags Kit Wilson into the match and Prince and Wilson go for a double suplex but Holland reverses and hits both Prince and Wilson with a suplex. Holland makes the tag to Sheamus who hits a series of lariats and then back breakers to both Prince and Wilson. Sheamus slams Prince on to Wilson and goes for a brogue kick but Wilson dodges it. Sheamus hits an Alabama slam and covers Wilson but Prince breaks the count at two. Sheamus grabs both Prince and Wilson on the ropes and hits a grand total of 31 beats of the Bodhran, Michael Cole says 30, I question his ability to count. Prince makes the blind tag as Sheamus slams Wilson to the mat. Prince flies out of nowhere to hit a leg drop, Prince then covers Sheamus for three.</p><p>Winners: Pretty Deadly</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Back live with Pretty Deadly celebrating their victory in the ring. Champions Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn then make their way out. Zayn says Pretty Deadly are owed congratulations, Zayn says he didn’t expect them to win, however they won five minutes ago and are still celebrating, by his calculations they’ve overstayed their welcome by five minutes. Prince says despite beating five teams their hair still looks drier and better than that mess right there. Wilson says that when they become new tag team champions they will celebrate for even longer, they say even longer about six times together. Zayn asks Owens if he hears this. Owens says that Zayn has been telling him to calm down but listening to them makes him “WANT TO SCREAM AND RUN DOWN THERE AND PUNCH THEM IN THEIR STUPID FACES!” Zayn says that they should and Owens and Zayn run towards the ring as Pretty Deadly flee the area.</p><p>We cut to backstage where Paul Heyman asks Roman Reigns if he has spoken with Jey Uso. Reigns says no and asks Heyman who the tribal chief is, reigns says that when Jey is tribal chief people will reach out to him, but right now people need to reach out to him. Reigns then demands Heyman talk to Jey right now. Heyman nervously stands up and runs out of the locker room.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Iyo Sky vs Zelina Vega</p><p>The match begins with Vega holding out her hand out for a handshake to which Sky responds by slapping Vega in the face. Sky hits a drop kick and hits a stomp to Vega’s arm off the middle rope. Vega hits a kick to the head on the mat. Bayley hops on the ring apron to cause a distraction. Sky gets a roll up but the ref is distracted for a second and does not make the count. Sky argues with Bayley and with Sky standing by the ropes Vega hits a 619 and rolls Sky up for the three count.</p><p>Winner: Zelina Vega</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Bianca Belair approaches Adam Pearce backstage and Belair fairly asks where her rematch is.

Bayley says Shotzi does not belong in the Money in the Bank ladder match. Shotzi challenges Bayely to a match for her spot in the match and Iyo Sky accepts on Bayley’s behalf.</p><p>We then cut back to the ring for a special edition of the Grayson Waller effect. Waller introduces his guest tonight, Charlotte Flair who then makes her way out to the ring. Waller mentions in two weeks Charlotte and Asuka will have a women’s title match. Waller references how Charlotte ended Asuka’s undefeated streak at WrestleMania 34. Waller asks Charlotte is she will become a 15 time women’s champion. Charlotte says since they’re talking numbers, she has Asuka’s number.</p><p>Charlotte and Waller are interrupted by Bianca Belair who makes her way out to the ring. Charlotte says she will not apologize, and that the line starts and ends with her. Belair says that she didn’t run away for months and that she did things the right way. Charlotte says she may have stepped away but she never ran. Charlotte says she’d been defeated and picked herself up 14 times, and that she’s a champion with or without a title and she asks if Belair can say the same. Belair says she’s the longest reigning women’s champion of the modern era, and she didn’t need to win the title 14 times to do it. Belair says she will be ringside for Charlotte and Asuka’s match, and that the title will come back to her, Belair drops the mic and leaves the ring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Paul Heyman approaches Jey Uso backstage. Heyman apologizes for telling him the truth last week. Heyman has Jimmy does not miss with his kick, he meant to kick Reigns at Night of Champions just like he meant to kick Jey last week. Heyman says Jey did not deserve that disrespect last week and for that he apologizes. Jey says he’s sorry too, and that if Jey’s in, Heyman’s still out.</p><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>AJ Styles & Michin vs Karrion Kross & Scarlett</p><p>The match begins with Styles and Kross in the ring.

Baron Corbin attacks Grimes and takes him out.</p><p>Rey Mysterio makes his way out to the ring. Mysterio says he has had many accomplishments in his career, but there is one he is most proud of, reforming LWO.

Zayn and Jey say nothing to each other before Zayn leaves and Jey keeps walking.</p><p>Roman Reigns then makes his entrance with Solo Sikoa and Paul Heyman with him ahead of Jey Uso’s decision on his future with the Bloodline.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>*Commercial break*</p><p>Back live with Reigns in the ring with the mic in hand. Reigns gets the Kentucky crowd to acknowledge him and Jey Uso then immediately makes his way out to the ring. Reigns says the crowd wants answers and asks Jey if he’s in or out. Jey tells Reigns to tell him. Jey points to Heyman and says it’s either Heyman or himself. Reigns says when Jey’s tribal chief he can pick anyone he wants to be wise man, but Heyman is his, he’s there to help Reigns, not the Bloodline. Reigns says he got them to the promised land, and it’s Jey’s job to keep them there. Reigns says they have been grooming Jey for over three years now, and that he’s meant to lead, just not yet. Reigns again says that the problem is Jimmy Uso.</p><p>Jimmy Uso then walks out and tells Jey that the problem is their cousin. Jimmy tells Jey that Reigns is using him. Reigns say that it took The Usos 10 years to get to WrestleMania but with Reigns, they have main evented it, Reigns tells Jey he can’t be tribal chief and a twin at the same time. Reigns asks Heyman who the only man to have a problem with Jey being named right hand man was. Jey then looks at Jimmy who stands there with his head down. Jey turns to face Jimmy and ask him if it’s true and Jimmy says that it is true. Jey says this whole time Jimmy has been doubting him, that he expects that from Reigns but not Jimmy. Jey says all he has heard his whole life is to listen to his older brother, that all his life he has been competing with Jimmy. Jey says a blessing happened in disguise, Jimmy got hurt and Jey stepped up. Jey says he became main event Jey Uso, and it’s all beause of Reigns.</p><p>Jey Uso tells Jimmy that Jimmy is out and then Jey says he’s out too and Jey Uso superkicks Roman Reigns to an incredibly loud pop. The Usos take Sikoa out of the ring. Reigns screams and gets to his feet, SmackDown goes off the air after The Usos hit Reigns with a double superkick as the crowd absolutely explodes.</p><p>That’s it for this week’s SmackDown.
