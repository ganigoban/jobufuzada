<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>The political landscape in the United States has been more polarized than at any time in recent history since</span><span>&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;</span><span>took office in 2017. As with every president before him, opposition and allies are the two non-negotiable sides of the coin he inherited.&nbsp;For Trump, one of the people who has stood as an ally since before he took office is Steve Cortes.</span></p><p><span>Cortes is a television broadcaster, author, and political commentator who fully supports Trump’s office and helped shape the narrative that brought him to power.&nbsp;Steve is not one to shy away from any kind of confrontation and has repeatedly used his position to fend off enemies and opponents of the current government.</span></p><p><span>But in addition to his political leanings, the former Trump campaign operative also has a strong track record in finance, market research and the media.&nbsp;Besides appearing regularly on networks like CNN and Fox, Cortes also regularly lends his financial expertise to CNBC, one of the world’s leading financial news networks.</span></p><p><span>Steve, affectionately nicknamed “El Capital”, has a healthy sense of humor.&nbsp;He frequently speaks at conventions, conferences and live colleges and isn’t afraid to take an unpopular stance on hot issues like immigration.</span></p><h2><b><span>Bio of Steve Cortes</span></b></h2><p><span>Steve’s date of birth, information about his early years, and an early yet unknown upbringing.&nbsp;However, he has three siblings, all daughters, from his parents.&nbsp;They were all raised in Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp;Cortes’ father immigrated to the United States where he was educated at Indiana Tech.&nbsp;Her father grew up on a ranch in Colombia in the 1930s.</span></p><p><span>For his education, Steve enrolled at Georgetown University in 1990. He was a brilliant student and earned himself a Rhodes Scholarship nomination.&nbsp;Apart from his studies, Steve Cortes was also active in the school football team.&nbsp;He was also a George F. Baker Scholar and graduated from Georgetown in 1994.</span></p><p><span>Cortes is married to his wife, Holly Cortes.&nbsp;They married on May 16, 1998, and together they have four children;&nbsp;three daughters and one son.</span></p><h2><b><span>Facts About Former Trump Campaign Agent</span></b></h2><p><strong><span>1. Steve Cortes worked in finance right out of school</span></strong></p><p><span>He is best known as a political commentator, but the media man had started his career in the financial sector.&nbsp;He started working for a company known as Prudential Financial, Inc., in 1994, the same year he left Georgetown.&nbsp;His job description at the company was to sell government bonds.</span></p><p><span>He soon added a Wall Street trader and strategist to his portfolio, a role he filled for about two decades.&nbsp;Cortes also leads the strategy department of BGC Partners.&nbsp;The company targets hedge funds and banks, providing them with risk management strategies.</span></p><p><span>Even when he became a broadcaster, the Chicago native started out with CNBC, where the topic of discussion was financial markets.&nbsp;His time as a political commentator came much later.</span></p><p><strong><span>2. He worked closely with the Trump administration</span></strong></p><p><span>At the height of the presidential race in 2016, Steve Cortes joined Trump’s campaign as his official TV surrogate.&nbsp;He also served as one of Trump’s Hispanic Advisory Council members.</span></p><p><span>After Trump took office, Steve was made an informal adviser to the president.&nbsp;He is also a regular Fox News contributor, particularly on the Halftime Report.&nbsp;</span><span>The Trump financial broadcaster and adviser continues to be a live broadcaster at Bloomberg TV, CNBC and Fox.</span></p><p><strong><span>3. Cortes is the founder of Veracruz LLC</span></strong></p><p><span>The former Trump surrogate took his money know-how a step further in 2002 with the founding of his own financial services company Veracruz LLC.&nbsp;The company serves broker-dealers, hedge funds, banks and sovereign wealth funds by providing real-time daily commentary and insights on the US equity and fixed income markets.</span></p><p><span>When Cortes named the company, he wanted to give it a religious spin, hence the name Veracruz.&nbsp;The word means “true cross” in Spanish.</span></p><p><strong><span>4. He published his first book in 2011</span></strong></p><p><span>Steve Cortes is known for often swimming against the tide when it comes to his political and financial assertions.&nbsp;In a similar vein, he published his first book in 2011, titled&nbsp;</span><i><span>Against the Herd: 6 Contrary Investing Strategies to Follow</span></i></p><p><span>In the book, he offers six seemingly counterintuitive viewpoints on the major events he believes will shape the future of global investments and markets.&nbsp;Some of these events include the end of free trade and the fall of China.&nbsp;It also shows how to take advantage of these events to make sound investment decisions.</span></p><p><span>The book also makes clear Cortes’ belief that the United States is and will increasingly become one of the best investment destinations in the world.</span></p><p><strong><span>5. His mother wanted him at Notre Dame University</span></strong></p><p><span>Steve’s mother was not entirely happy with her choice of Georgetown University.&nbsp;She wanted her son to enroll in the University of Notre Dame.&nbsp;</span><span>Even though his wish did not come true, other family members decided to go this route.&nbsp;One of Steve’s sisters and his niece are University of Notre Dame alumni.</span></p><p><strong><span>6. Steve Cortes met his wife through a friend who was interested in her.</span></strong></p><p><span>Cortes only met his wife for the first time because one of his college buddies at the time was after her.&nbsp;On one occasion, said friend wanted to hang out with Holly and decided to bring Cortes with him.</span></p><p><span>One thing led to another, and eventually Cortes fell in love with Holly and they started dating.&nbsp;Since their marriage in 1998, the couple have three daughters – Chase, Kingsley and Elizabeth – and a son whose name is unknown.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirpJrDpnnCqKmtnaNir6q7jJ%2BYnKyjYq6ju9StZJ%2BnoqKys3nTq6ymqF2Yrq68wKKep2WRnLKvwI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-cortes-bio-facts-about-former-trump-campaign-agent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./summer-kellsey-net-worth-186774.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./summer-kellsey-net-worth-186774.html>Summer Kellsey Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./steve-carell-responds-silver-fox.html>Steve Carell Responds to Internet Reaction on Hot Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./steve-carell-responds-silver-fox.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
