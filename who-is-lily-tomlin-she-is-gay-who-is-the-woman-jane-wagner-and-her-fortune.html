in her legacy.&nbsp;Have you ever wondered how much wealth she has accumulated over the year?</span></p><p><span>Here is your answer:</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net worth of Lily Tomlin</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tomlin has won multiple Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing and a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album in 40 years on and off screen.&nbsp;Therefore, it is no surprise that his net worth reaches $15 million.&nbsp;She rose to prominence as America’s youngest standing comedienne in the early 1960s.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is She Gay, Who’s The Wife – Jane Wagner</span></strong></h2><p><span>With all of her accomplishments over the years, it might be confusing to wonder if Lily Tomlin ever married or was on a date with a Prince Charming in her circle.&nbsp;There was no mention of a man she might have been dating or marrying, leading to speculation about her sexuality.</span></p><p><span>Tomlin is gay and married to his wife, Jane Wagner, his partner of more than four decades.&nbsp;The couple had been together for 46 years as work partners and as a couple, but it wasn’t until 2013 that they decided to get married.</span></p><p><span>Wagner is a writer, director and producer who is best known as the comedian, collaborator of Tomlin.&nbsp;She is the mastermind behind the show titled&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe</span></i><span>&nbsp;(1985) which won Tomlin the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Play.</span></p><p><span>The couple met in 1971 and began dating soon after.&nbsp;However, The Grace and Frankie star’s sexuality isn’t something she chooses to reveal to the public.&nbsp;In one of her 2015 interviews, Lily Tomlin said her witty, sweet mother would “literally” be dead if she came out as gay while she was alive.</span></p><p><span>It was reported that in 1975, Time Magazine offered her a cover if she was willing to come out.&nbsp;Despite all the encouragement from fans at the time, she declined, citing that being portrayed as the gay celebrity was not something she was interested in.</span></p><p><span>As for her vision of marriage, Tomlin told You don’t really need to get married, but it’s “terribly nice,” and a lot of people she knows who are married are happy and happy about it.&nbsp;She said if they [she and Wagner] had kids, that would mean something more.</span></p><p class=postsid
