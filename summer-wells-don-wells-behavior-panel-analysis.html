There were no anomalies.</p><p>"Some have pointed out that he looked nervous around authorities. Ya of course. He’s been in trouble with the law before. He’s not a choirboy and he doesn’t pretend to be, but I don’t think he did this.”</p><h2>WHERE IS SUMMER?</h2><p>Summer was last seen on June 15, 2021 in her Hawkins County, Tennessee home, and an AMBER alert was issued the next day.</p><p>The Wells family has said she went to the basement to play with toys after planting flowers in the front yard with her grandmother and mother and seemingly vanished.</p><p>The court of public opinion turned on Mr Wells and his family - and pointed the finger at them.</p><p>But the family has maintained that Summer&nbsp;<a href=#>was abducted by an unknown perpetrator</a>.</p><p>In March it was reported that Summer's family&nbsp;<a href=#>"wasn't co-operating"</a>&nbsp;with law enforcement as the search for their daughter continues.</p><p>Candus Bly, Summer's mom, wrote a note to a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WJHL</a>, which was forwarded to The Sun by a family spokesperson, that denied the sheriff's wall-of-silence allegations.</p><h2>A FATHER'S LETTER TO 'KIDNAPPERS'</h2><p>The Sun revealed Mr Wells' letter from jail that pleaded with the "person or persons responsible for kidnapping Summer" midnight Monday into Tuesday.</p><p>The letter was part of six-minute, narrated video released by a family spokesperson while Wells remains in jail&nbsp;<a href=#>for a DUI arrest</a>.</p><p>"Please do the right thing and turn our daughter over to the authorities," he wrote in the letter.
