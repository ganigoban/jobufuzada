As the founder of L Brands Inc., which once included iconic brands such as Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, Wexner has built a legacy in the retail industry. As we approach 2024, there is growing interest in the net worth of this business magnate, philanthropist, and once the longest-serving CEO of a Fortune 500 company.</p><h3 id=les-wexners-financial-overview-ZBZEAIRqvY>Les Wexner’s Financial Overview</h3><table><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Detail</th></tr><tr><td>Estimated Net Worth:</td><td>$5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Age:</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>September 8, 1937</td></tr><tr><td>Country of Origin:</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Source of Wealth:</td><td>Retail, Investments</td></tr></table><h2 id=the-genesis-of-wexners-wealth-ZBZEAIRqvY>The Genesis of Wexner’s Wealth</h2><p>Les Wexner’s journey to financial success began with a single clothing store in Columbus, Ohio, called The Limited. The store, which opened in 1963, was funded by a $5,000 loan from his aunt.

This led to the acquisition and development of various other brands, including Victoria’s Secret, which he bought in 1982 and transformed into a global lingerie powerhouse.</p><h2 id=peak-valuation-and-recent-trends-ZBZEAIRqvY>Peak Valuation and Recent Trends</h2><p>At its peak, L Brands was a retail juggernaut, and Wexner’s net worth soared.
