Seagulls are well known for mobbing and bombarding their enemies with feces from above—whether a fox looking for gull chicks for lunch, or humans walking on the beach. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Do all birds poop in flight?</h2>Absolutely they do.

While asleep their stool and urine combine together in what's called cloaca. When they awake the whole nights supply gets emptied. The green stringy looking stuff is the stool and the white and liquid part is urine. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What Does It Mean When a Bird Poops On You?</h2><h2>Do birds poop right after eating?</h2>Our observations showed that almost all of the defecation by nestling birds occurred at a “right time”, immediately after feeding.
