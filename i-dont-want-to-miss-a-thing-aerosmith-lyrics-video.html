Don't watch me breathe. I won't be able to sleep. Go do something else.' It's so funny, because part of me would never want someone to say that to me, but then again, I write it."</p></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>What movie was it used in?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf-images.eu-west-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/6057949401001/7f864eed-d307-4774-b073-f1c094910994/2c5efa16-6bfe-4f40-946d-f3a682228d49/640x360/match/image.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Armageddon trailer (1998)</p><ul><li>The song was written for the 1998 disaster movie Armageddon starring <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>U2</a> were apparently in line to record the song, but once Liv Tyler was cast, her father Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith were chosen instead.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie became the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.</li></ul><ul><li>Celine Dion was also considered, with Warren later saying: "I remember being at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, and sitting at the piano with [Tyler] and teaching him the song and just having chills all over my body as I heard the song come to life with his voice and knowing what it was going to be. It was an amazing experience. I'd written with Aerosmith before, and they'd never done the songs we wrote."</li></ul></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>What happens in the music video?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/JkK8g6FMEXE/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Aerosmith - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (Official HD Video)</p><ul><li>It was shot at the Minneapolis Armory in 1998, and was directed by Francis Lawrence. It sees the band playing the song along with scenes from the film. Steven Tyler injured his knee the day before, so they used a lot of close-ups as his movement was limited.</li></ul><ul><li>At the end of the video, the screen goes out as a tearful Grace (Liv Tyler) touches one of the monitors to reach out to her father (real life father Steven in the video; on-screen father Harry, played by Bruce Willis, in the film).</li></ul></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>How did it perform in the charts?</h2><figure>Aerosmith - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing. <span class=attribution>Picture: Columbia/Epic</span></figure><ul><li>Aerosmith had been around since the 1970s, but this was by far their biggest hit and gave them a huge comeback.</li></ul><ul><li>It was also their only number one in the US, staying on top for four weeks. It has also sold over a million copies in the UK, peaking at four.</li></ul><ul readability=1.5><li readability=6>Aerosmith didn't care that their biggest hit was written by somebody else. Joe Perry said: "At the time, we just didn't have the time to settle down and do it. We were out on the road, so they brought us in to see the movie and said 'here's the song, this is where it fits into the movie, you can do it if you want.'<p>So we were in the studio within the next three days cutting it. And yeah, we do wish that we'd had a little more time, so that we could have had a shot at writing it, but it was perfect timing. The song was great, people loved it, and I don't think people care that much who wrote it."</p></li></ul></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZq2glWLAtbvRsmSonl%2BeeqW7za1ksJmeqXq1u4ymoKyrXZZ6tbTIp55mmZWnvLS5yK2fZqSpp7akv4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith-lyrics-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./utter-complete-downfall-wendy-williams.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./utter-complete-downfall-wendy-williams.html>The Utter And Complete Downfall Of Wendy Williams</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1706-html.html>Tamara Manhoef Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1706-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
