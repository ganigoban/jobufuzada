T. rex is estimated to have weighed between 11,000 and 15,500 pounds (5,000 and 7,000 kilograms) with skin and flesh on its huge bones. That’s about as much as the largest African elephant.</p><h3>How tall was the tallest T. rex?</h3><p>The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3–12.4 m (40–41 ft) in length, but according to most modern estimates, Tyrannosaurus could have exceeded sizes of 13 m (43 ft) in length, 3.7–4 m (12–13 ft) in hip height, and 8 tonnes (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons) in mass.</p><h3>What is the biggest T. rex ever recorded?</h3><p>Weighing an estimated 19,555 pounds, the equivalent of four pickup trucks, and measuring nearly 42 feet long. Scotty took more than two decades to fully excavate and analyze and was named the largest member of its species ever found, as well as the longest-lived T. rex, according to the fossil record.</p><h3>How tall was a velociraptor?</h3><p>Velociraptor was a small to medium-sized dromaeosaurid, with adults measuring between 1.5–2.07 m (4.9–6.8 ft) long, approximately 0.5 m (1.6 ft) high at the hips, and weighing about 14.1–19.7 kg (31–43 lb).</p><h3>How tall is the allosaurus?</h3><p>Allosaurus was up to 38 feet long and 16.5 feet tall. It had a 3-foot long skull with two short brow-horns and bony knobs and ridges above its eyes and on the top of the head. It had large, powerful jaws with long, sharp serrated teeth that were 2 to 4 inches long.</p><h3>How BIG Was The T-REX REALLY!? (New Discovery)</h3><p>No information provided.</p><h3>How tall is a baryonyx?</h3><p>Baryonyx measured 30 feet (9 meters) long, 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall, and weighed on average 4,000 pounds (2 tons) that’s equivalent to a modern day Rhino. Baryonyx had two small arms with foot long thumb claws and a crest on its crocodile-like jaw and over 95 serrated saw-like teeth.</p><h3>How tall is the ankylosaurus?</h3><p>Ankylosaurus magniventris was a type of armoured dinosaur. It was the largest of its type, with a maximum length of 8 metres (26 feet) and height of 2 metres (6 feet).</p><h3>How tall is the stegosaurus?</h3><p>The average stegosaurus was about 30 feet long, between 9 and 13 feet tall, weighed about 5.5 tons (11,000 pounds), and had a very small brain (about the size of a walnut). Stegosaurus lived on grassless savannas in what is now North America; many stegosaurus fossils have been found in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.</p><h3>How big were gigas?</h3><p>Estimates for the most complete specimen range from a length of 12 to 13 m (39 to 43 ft), a skull 1.53 to 1.80 m (5.0 to 5.9 ft) in length, and a weight of 4.2 to 13.8 t (4.6 to 15.2 short tons).</p><h3>Could the T. rex be 70 bigger?</h3><p>Rex may have tipped the scales at a whopping 15,000 kilograms. This would make them heavier than an average school bus which weighs roughly 11,000 kg! And the study indicates that they were nearly 70% bigger than Scotty — the heaviest T. rex discovered to date weighing about 8,870 kilograms.</p><h3>Was T. rex bigger than Giga?</h3><p>Giganotosaurus was probably about 45 to 47 feet long, while the largest T. rex specimen reached nearly 42 feet long (nicknamed “Scotty,” its bones reside at Canada’s Royal Saskatchewan Museum). Both stood about 20 feet tall, and Giganotosaurus may have had a few tons of mass on T.</p><h3>How fast could at Rex run?</h3><p>A T-Rex is estimated to have been able to run at speeds of up to 12-18 miles per hour (19-29 kilometers per hour).</p><h3>What did T. rex evolve from?</h3><p>Daspletosaurus torosus is most widely accepted as the direct ancestor to Tyrannosaurus rex. The only notable differences between the two are that Daspletosaurus possesses proportionally larger teeth, longer arms, and smaller feet, and is overall more muscular and heavily built than Tyrannosaurus.</p><h3>What dinosaur was 6 feet tall?</h3><p>Dimetrodon: 5 – 6 feet tall, 6 to 15 feet long – Carnivore from the Early Permian Period. Ornithomimus: 6 feet tall, 10 feet long – Omnivore from the Late Cretaceous Period.</p><h3>How big is a allosaurus?</h3><p>Allosaurus weighed two tons and grew to 10.5 metres (35 feet) in length, although fossils indicate that some individuals could have reached 12 metres.</p><h3>How tall was the Therizinosaurus?</h3><p>Therizinosaurus was a colossal therizinosaurid that could grow up to 9–10 m (30–33 ft) long and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) tall, and weigh possibly over 5 t (5.5 short tons).</p><h3>Which Dino is the tallest?</h3><p>Even though only about 20 percent of the skeleton was found, comparisons with similar dinosaurs led to estimates that Brachiosaurus was more than 60 feet long and more than 40 feet tall, a giant that towered over the likes of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.</p><h3>How tall is the carnotaurus?</h3><p>Carnotaurus measured up to 30 feet (9 meters) long, 10 feet (3 meters) tall, and weighed up to 4000 pounds (2 tons).</p><h3>How tall is the giganotosaurus?</h3><p>Giganotosaurus was a member of a family of large carnivorous dinosaurs that also included Mapusaurus and Carcharodontosaurus. Giganotosaurus is thought to have reached a length of 12−13 meters (about 40−43 feet), a height of 7 meters (about 23 feet), and a weight of 7,000–8,000 kg (about 15,400–17,600 pounds).</p><h3>How big is a Spinosaurus?</h3><p>At 14 metres (46 feet) long from nose to tail, Spinosaurus was longer than any other carnivorous dinosaur known to science. But we don’t have any complete skeletons, so the full length is just an estimate.</p><h3>How big is a Dilophosaurus?</h3><p>Most of the dinosaurs of the Late Triassic of western North America, just 20 million years earlier, were animals the size of turkeys or eagles, but Dilophosaurus would have towered over a human, standing up to eight feet tall and measuring up to 25 feet long when fully grown.</p><h3>How big is a Torvosaurus?</h3><p>Torvosaurus was a very large and robust predatory dinosaur, with an estimated maximum body length of 10–11 meters (33–36 ft) and mass of 4–5 metric tons (4.4–5.5 short tons) for the Portuguese species T. gurneyi.</p><h3>How tall is saurophaganax?</h3><p>Characteristics. Length estimates range from 10.5 to 13 meters. At its head, Saurophaganax would have been around 4 meters tall. It’s mass estimates range from 3,000 to 4,500 kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKixzqCpmqiYnrBussCqZqGnp2LBorjLZq6aq12WerV50Z6vaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-tall-was-a-t-rex.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./if-youre-a-single-guy-in-ghana-then-youre-likely-to-be-broke-michael-blackson-says.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./if-youre-a-single-guy-in-ghana-then-youre-likely-to-be-broke-michael-blackson-says.html>If Youre A Single Guy In Ghana, Then Youre Likely To Be Broke Michael Blackson Says</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-nike.html>How old do you have to be to work at Nike?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-nike.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
