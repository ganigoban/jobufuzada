With the seasons changing, some of us may be feeling more down than usual at the moment.</p><p id=eYD1uEDdBAMj data-wc=77>The last few winters have been harder than previous years because of the stress and uncertainty brought by the pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis. SAD on top of this, is a bad mix. <strong>If you’re feeling down and are worried SAD may be playing a part, you should see your GP, who can carry out an assessment and recommend a course of treatment.&nbsp;</strong>Many sufferers turn to SAD lamps for light therapy to help alleviate their symptoms.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Best SAD lamps at a glance</h3><p id=eDLj7505xy>Best light-therapy alarm clock - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Lumie Sunrise Alarm</a></span></p><p id=e2WxDqFoCg>Best SAD lamp with extra features - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Philips Sleep and Wake Up Light</a></span></p><p id=eJydv_pRkA->Best large SAD lamp - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Lumie Brazil 10,000 lux Lamp</a></span></p><p id=eRB1YqLhaq->Best tablet-style SAD lamp - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Beurer TL30UK 10,000 lux SAD lamp</a></span></p><p id=elOe6M-F45P>Best decorative SAD lamp - <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Albina SAD Light Therapy Lamp</a><br></p><p id=eu59eNM8eGB>Best slimline SAD lamp - <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Lumie Vitamin L Slim Light Box</a></p><p id=e5SuXLW6gUx>Best desk light SAD lamp - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Lumie DESKLAMP</a></span></p><p id=eM0Py8CeBVU- data-wc=30>So what exactly is SAD, and how do you know if you've got it? We spoke to Stephen Buckley, Head of Information at mental health charity <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Mind</a>, for more information.</p><p id=eAfIwxzlRL2O data-wc=93>&nbsp;“Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression experienced in certain seasons," says Stephen. "Depression is a low mood that lasts for a long time or keeps returning and can have a significant impact on your daily life. There is a difference between feeling down because of the weather and experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Many people are affected by changes in seasons. For example, we might feel more cheerful and energetic when the sun is shining and the days are longer. And we might eat more and sleep longer in winter.&nbsp;</p><p id=eq8OLS4D-zEP data-wc=59>“If you have SAD, the change in seasons has a much greater effect on mood and energy levels, leading to symptoms of depression that have a significant impact on day-to-day life. The causes of SAD aren’t always clear, but we know that a lack of daylight can have a big impact on mood, especially during the autumn and winter.”</p><p id=euVuheD_hzP_ data-wc=60>Is light therapy effective? What should we look out for or consider when buying a SAD lamp? Stephen says: “Some people with winter SAD find it helpful to use a light therapy – a device that gives off strong white or blue light; or a lamp or alarm clock that simulates dawn. This is also known as a light box.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaj5qPnhDMNk data-wc=41>“The NHS doesn't usually provide light therapy because there isn't yet much evidence to show it works, although some people find it helpful. So more research needs to be done to establish why it works for some people and not others.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQTDHvMlSSMb data-wc=40>“You can buy light therapy equipment yourself but unfortunately it tends to be expensive. The <a class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NHS website</a> has more information about how light therapy works, who can use light therapy safely, and tips on how to choose a light box.”</p><h2>How do SAD lamps work?</h2><p id=e_RYUgygwWwC data-wc=38>SAD lamps send out bright light which hits the retina and sends nerve signals to the brain, positively affecting the chemical and hormone levels and improving the mood of the sufferer. <strong>This is known as SAD light therapy.</strong></p><p id=ezQCqNCYoOCJ style=text-align:center data-wc=10><strong>WATCH: A sneak peek at our favourite tablet-style SAD lamp</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2>Do SAD lamps give you vitamin D or a tan?</h2><p id=eHhzvEM51yxK data-wc=28>No. Certified SAD lamps filter out most or all ultraviolet light. Using SAD lamps for light therapy will not give you a tan or increase vitamin D levels.</p><h2>What is the best SAD lamp to buy?</h2><p id=ePCNH3QvRjlE data-wc=23>A SAD lamp needs to have a brightness of at least 2,500 lux to qualify and be medically certified for treating the disorder.</p><p id=eSlZwzJUXU2O data-wc=38>There are models with higher brightness, however, going up to as much as 10,000 lux. The brighter the light, the shorter the session of SAD light therapy needed. Between 30 minutes to an hour a day is recommended.</p><h2>Can I use a SAD lamp at night? What about with my eyes closed?</h2><p id=e-vHIAZuifXD data-wc=58>Most SAD light therapy is prescribed to be done in the early morning upon waking. Sufferers put the SAD light box on a desk or table and sit in front of it at a specified distance while they read or eat breakfast. Studies vary as to whether light therapy at other times of the day is less effective.</p><p id=e846enF98BVJ data-wc=39>For light therapy to be effective, light from the SAD lamp must enter the eyes indirectly. The eyes should be open but the user shouldn’t stare directly at the light box, as the bright light can damage the eyes</p><h2>Where can I buy a SAD lamp?</h2><p id=eqPZWtmKK0BD data-wc=58>There are a variety of medically certified SAD lamps available online on Amazon – see our top picks below. Even if you don’t have SAD, a light therapy box can help lift your mood and regulate your circadian rhythm – the natural internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle – which can get thrown off in the winter.</p><p id=ewF3Ahktz1Gx data-wc=38>Anyone with a history of clinical depression or bipolar disorder should check with a medical professional first before trying, however, psychologists say that SAD lamps can affect medication or produce an exaggerated response in anyone with these conditions.</p><h2>Best light-therapy alarm clock: Lumie Sunrise Alarm</h2><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a801f8321b9c-lumie-clock-z.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">£10.84 (SAVE 15%) AT AMAZON</a><p id=emRu1AsL_Du6 data-wc=6><strong>Star rating:</strong> 4.3 out of 5</p><p id=eozt8AwZxyLe data-wc=43>This works slightly differently from regular SAD lamps. It’s designed to wake you up with light, as nature intended. It wakes you up with an artificial sunrise which begins 30 mins before your alarm time and natural sounds can be added in too.</p><p id=eFNlOXk1AdNB data-wc=52>It also has a sunset setting that can be used to wind down at bedtime. It’s been claimed that waking up with light can reset your internal clock and metabolism, allowing you to greet the day alert and refreshed. Lumie describe their clocks as an addition to light therapy, not an alternative.</p><p id=esQKqNmPnCUW data-wc=69>This model has lots of settings including the sunset feature which I absolutely love, it really helps you to unwind and I generally fall asleep before the light goes out.

This could help you notice any patterns.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make the most of natural light</strong> – for example, spend time in parks or gardens, or sit near a window. Going for walks, particularly around midday or on bright days, even if it’s just taking a short stroll at lunch, can be effective in reducing symptoms.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>While you may not feel like it during the winter, physical activity can be very effective</strong> in lifting your mood and increasing your energy levels. Research shows that outdoor exercise, such as cycling or jogging, can be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Drink plenty of water and eat a healthy balanced diet.</strong> As tempting as it is to reach for comfort foods to cheer you up, eating lots of foods high in fat and carbohydrates can often cause blood sugar levels to crash, resulting in sluggishness. A healthy balanced diet is as important for your mental health as your physical health, so it’s best to include lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as fatty oils such as omega-3 and 6.</li><li><strong>Plan ahead for winte</strong><strong>r</strong> – for example, make meals in advance and freeze them if you know you may lack the energy to do this during a difficult period.&nbsp;</li><p id=e2L_HduPAG>“Talk to your GP if you’ve noticed changes to your feelings, thoughts and behaviour that last longer than two weeks or keep returning. Your GP should be able to tell you what help and support is available. If appropriate, they may refer you for talking treatments - such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy - which can be very useful. Antidepressants may be prescribed if you have severe SAD.”</p><h2>How we chose the best SAD Lamps</h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Trusted brands:</strong> Where possible, we included the SAD lamps that the HELLO!
