He is a CrossFit athlete.</strong></p><p>Khrennikov is the most famous athlete in Russia. In his home country and around the world, he is known as a CrossFit legend. The athlete has also qualified for CrossFit Games since 2019, but he couldn’t go to two of them because his visa was turned down twice.</p><h2>Did Roman Khrennikov Get A US Visa?</h2><p>Roman Khrennikov finally got a visa after coming twice without one. He had been trying for four years to get a visa so he could go to the CrossFit Games, and he finally got it in 2022.</p><p>Khrennikov had originally applied for a tourist visa, but CrossFit Inc. helped him apply for an athletic visa, which meant he could come to the US and compete for the next five years.</p><p>Roza and Pat Giles were also very important to Khrennikov’s trip to the US. They had never met him, but they vouched for him. Without their help, he would not have made it to the CrossFit Games.</p><h2>Roman Khrennikov’s race and country of birth</h2><p>Khrennikov is a 27-year-old Russian athlete from Irkutsk. He hasn’t shared enough information about his past, so not much is known about him.</p><p>The athlete has stayed professional and hasn’t said much about his personal life. He only posts about his accomplishments to let his fans know how he’s doing in his games and how he’s getting better.</p><p>Roman’s Instagram handle is @roman khrennikov, and he has made 699 posts there. Also, as of the 8th of August 2022, he had 64.4k followers on the platform.</p><p>Now that he has fans from all over the world who want to know more about him, the Crossfit athlete should be more open about himself to keep his fans up to date. Also, the number of people who follow him on social media is likely to grow by hundreds of thousands in the coming days.</p><h2>Has Roman Khrennikov tied the knot? See His Wife And Children</h2><p>Roman is married to the woman he loves, Anastasiya Khrennikova, who is also into fitness and nutrition, and they have a cute little boy.</p><p>The athlete appears to have gotten married to his girlfriend in 2015. But the couple said when they would say their wedding vows and promise to spend their lives together.</p><p>Also, the Khrennikovs had their first child in 2022, and on April 3, 2023, their son will turn one. To get to the 2022 NOBULL CrossFit Games, he had to leave his pregnant wife alone.</p><p>The family was finally reunited a few days ago, and Anastasiya posted their first picture with the baby on August 3, 2022. She has 4.6k followers and has made 1.7k posts under the handle @khrennikova anastasiya. They also like dogs, and they have two of their own.</p><h2>Roman Khrennikov Worth in 2022</h2><p>The Russian CrossFit star hasn’t said how much he makes from his job, but we think his net worth is probably between $500,000 and $800,000.</p><p>Khrennikov runs the online training program RX Pro, which has different packages to help people get in shape and become better athletes. In the same way, he seems to be sponsored by brands like GOWOD, Brute Strength, Aerobic Capacity, Unbroken® Real-Time Recovery, TYR Sport, and PicSil Sport.</p><p>The athlete has also done amazing things in his home country. He beat Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson, Adrian Mundwiler, and Lukas Hogberg, among others, and won the Europe Regional. Roman has also taken part in a number of competitions, such as the Dubai Crossfit Championship, the Crossfit Italian Showdown, the Crossfit Open, the Crossfit Strength in Depth, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWibopxdp7yurc1moqGqlaO7qrfOr2SgnaRirm7B0matoquRZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-roman-khrennikov-get-a-us-visa.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./do-command-strips-adhere-to-glass-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./do-command-strips-adhere-to-glass-html.html>Do Command strips adhere to glass?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dancing-with-the-stars-season-32-cast-revealed-heres-who-is-competing-and-their-pro-partners.html>Dancing with the Stars Season 32 cast revealed: Heres who is competing and their pro partners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dancing-with-the-stars-season-32-cast-revealed-heres-who-is-competing-and-their-pro-partners.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
