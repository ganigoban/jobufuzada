Mike Tomlin is currently the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a job he has held since 2007. Tomlin has never lost a season with the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>He has led the franchise to 10 playoff appearances, three AFC Championship games, and two Super Bowls. Mike is the 10th African American head coach in NFL history, but the first for the Steelers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Mike Tomlin?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Tomlin</a> was born on March 15, 1972, in Hampton, Virginia, as the youngest of two sons. His father, Ed, played football at Hampton Institute in the 1960s and was picked by the Baltimore Colts. Ed Tomlin later played for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. Mike, however, knew nothing about his father and was reared primarily by his mother, Julia, and stepfather.</p><p>Mike Tomlin attended Denbigh High School in Newport News, Virginia, and graduated in 1990. Although Tomlin never made it to the NFL, he did play as a wide receiver/tight end in college. Tomlin was also named All-Yankee Conference in 1994 while playing wide receiver at the College of William and Mary.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Mike Tomlin?</h2><p>He is currently 51 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Mike Tomlin’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $30 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Mike Tomlin’s career?</h2><p>Mike Tomlin began working as the Virginia Military Institute’s wide receivers coach in 1995. He spent the 1996 season as a graduate assistant at the University of Memphis, where he worked with the defensive backs and special teams. Tomlin subsequently drew the attention of Arkansas State University, which hired him to coach its defensive backs. He played two seasons there before moving on to coach defensive backs at the University of Cincinnati.</p><p>By the turn of the 2000, Tomlin had become an NFL coach, serving as assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers under head coach Tony Dungy. This is where he learnt the Tampa 2 defense, which he would use later in his coaching career. The Buccaneers defeated the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII, 48-21. Brad Childress hired Tomlin as the Minnesota Vikings’ defensive coordinator in 2006.</p><p>In 2007, Tomlin was hired as the Pittsburgh Steelers’ head coach. The specifics of his contract were never officially revealed, but the “Pittsburgh Post-Gazette” stated it was a four-year deal worth $2.5 million each year.</p><p>In addition to being the Steelers’ first black head coach, Tomlin became the NFL’s tenth black coach. When the Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27-23 in Super Bowl XLIII, Tomlin became the NFL’s youngest head coach to win the game. He was 36 at the time of his victory. Mike Tomlin has never lost a game in his first 16 seasons as a head coach, which is the longest active streak in the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqagpJ1dqbyuuMinZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-tomlin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./artie-lange-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./artie-lange-net-worth-2024.html>Artie Lange Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beauty-of-joseon-revive-eye-serum-amazon-8610748.html>10,000+ Shoppers Just Bought This Retinal Eye Serum That Works Miracles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beauty-of-joseon-revive-eye-serum-amazon-8610748.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
