This prevents the drum from sliding about within the washer, so preventing it from being damaged.</description></item><item><title>Candice Pool Biography, Net worth, Age, Married, Husband, Parents, Family</title><link>/candice-pool-bio-net-worth-age-married-husband-parents-family-wiki.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/candice-pool-bio-net-worth-age-married-husband-parents-family-wiki.html</guid><description>Candice Pool is a successful wife, mother, business owner, fashion and jewelry designer.&amp;nbsp;With little formal training and experience, Candice became one of New York City‚Äôs most successful jewelers with clients ranging from models to movie stars.&amp;nbsp;His exploits as a jeweler earned him a nomination for the prestigious Vogue Fashion Fund Award.

YES! Actually, the dryer is responsible for the majority of the shrinkage. The larger the proportion of cotton in the mix, the greater the likelihood that the garment will shrink when washed in hot water.
