GREENE Typical military facility, and the gold doesn't sparkle and it isn't fancy.</p><p>It weighs a ton.</p><p>And you drop one on your hands, you'll break every bone in your hand.</p><p>So the glamor wears off about bar number two, and you realize you're not getting to take any of it, you know?</p><p>So, yeah, it's not Goldfinger.</p><p>The US Gold Depository in Fort Knox exists to house America's treasures.</p><p>And initially, it started as a depository for for gold bullion and later on has developed into a kind of a holding cell for a lot of other things beside bullion.</p><p>Over the years, it's housed some of the great treasures of America, like the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</p><p>They also held it back during that time period, the Magna card of the British Magna Carta.</p><p>Keep it out of the hands of the Nazis as they amass great treasures.</p><p>And they had such things as the crown of St Stephen, their ones that were the Hungarian crown jewels into the 1950s of stockpiling of drugs inside the gold vault for for use in in the manufacture of morphine and stuff, in case a nuclear attack on the United States.</p><p>The security at the gold vault has been updated over the years, but even in the 1930s it was considered to be the ultimate.</p><p>They made it the most secure place on earth in the earlier days.</p><p>Security at Fort Knox was good, but today it's almost done believable.</p><p>We used to be able to drive tourists up in front of the gold vault and take a picture of them standing in front of the Goldwater way.</p><p>You would in front of any other government building.</p><p>Nowadays, if you go by the gold wall and pull out a camera, the conference gated.</p><p>In the post 911 World, it probably has everything.</p><p>It should be security wise.</p><p>But as one who was there in the 1970s, security at the Bullion Depository was mostly legit.</p><p>Guards carried Thompson submachine guns and 38 caliber pistols.</p><p>And I mean, it was it was old school, old school, FBI stuff, you know, bunch of metal stacked in a building.</p><p>That's not fun.</p><p>It's more fun to believe that you've got pop up machine guns and that you've got minefields and ground to air missiles, you know, And I can flood the vault.</p><p>The security array around that building over the years has grown massively.</p><p>When I was a kid, there were trees all around the gold vault.</p><p>It was woods all over the place there.</p><p>But it's not like that now.</p><p>So after 911, I mean, Fort Knox went into serious lockdown.</p><p>And as you know, to this day, you can no longer stand out on the street, take pictures.</p><p>These these guys take security very seriously.</p><p>When you say Fort Knox, Kentucky.</p><p>Most people think of the gold vault.</p><p>They even forget it.</p><p>There's soldiers at Fort Knox.</p><p>Even if you go to a foreign country and you say Fort Knox, they know what you're talking about.</p><p>It is one of those things that makes us kind of who we are.</p><p>We say to ourselves, you know, we're a powerful country and the wealth of this country is world renowned.</p><p>And I think if you go into any country in the civilized world and you say Fort Knox, they say gold and they say the United States.</p><p class=postsid
