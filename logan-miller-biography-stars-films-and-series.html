<time>14 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Logan Miller is a popular American actor known for the characters he has portrayed in films and television.&nbsp;He has since achieved his breakthrough role as the younger Matthew McConaughey’s character in the film&nbsp;</span><span>Ghost of Girlfriend’s Past.</span><span>&nbsp;He has starred in several other films and television series such as&nbsp;</span><span>Love Simon, I’m in the Band, The Stanford Prison Experiment, A Dog’s Purpose, Growing Up Fisher,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The walking dead.</span></p><p><span>Miller has warmed his way into the hearts of millions of film viewers around the world, impressing with his acting talent and charisma.&nbsp;He’s one of the rising stars in the industry, and if all goes well, he might one day find his name on Hollywood’s A-list list of actors.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Logan Miller Biography and Celebrity Profile</span></strong></h2><p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>Living Dead</span><span>&nbsp;actor was born on February 18, 1992 in Englewood, Colorado.&nbsp;Although the actor is of American nationality, he is of mixed ancestry: German, English, French and Irish.&nbsp;Logan grew up in multiple places as his parents had to move a lot due to work.&nbsp;He was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Minnesota’s Shakopee neighborhood and Flower Mound, Texas, where his parents currently reside.</span></p><p><span>Very little information is available about Logan’s Miller family history, parents’ occupations, siblings, or where he went to school.&nbsp;It’s unclear if he finished college or what he studied.&nbsp;Personally, Logan is not yet married, and he has managed to keep his past relationships a secret.&nbsp;Perhaps he prefers to keep his relationship life private since every other aspect of his life is played out in front of cameras and screens.</span></p><p><span>The Colorado native was previously in a relationship with Elizabeth Gillies in 2011, although it was an open affair and it wasn’t very long before they went their separate ways.&nbsp;After that, Logan dated Caitlyn Taylor Love for a while, but that relationship also ended prematurely.&nbsp;For now, he remains single and focused on building his career.</span></p><p><span>Logan Miller made his acting debut on the popular television series&nbsp;</span><span>The Norton Avenue All-Star</span><span>, playing the character Drew Apple.&nbsp;His role on the series opened the door for him to have a bigger role in the 2009 film&nbsp;</span><span>Ghosts of Girlfriend’s Past,</span><span>&nbsp;where he played the young version of Matthew McConaughey’s protagonist.&nbsp;This led to more opportunities to appear in other films like&nbsp;</span><span>Take Me To The River, The Bling Ring</span><span>&nbsp;and more.&nbsp;He also played Tripp Campbell in&nbsp;</span><span>I’m in the Band</span><span>&nbsp;a Disney comedy series.</span></p><p><span>The charming actor has been brought further into the spotlight after landing a role on the critically acclaimed series&nbsp;</span><span>The Walking Dead</span><span>&nbsp;as the character Benjamin.&nbsp;He also landed starring roles as Kent McFuller in&nbsp;</span><span>Before I</span><span>&nbsp;Fall and Collin Croyle in&nbsp;</span><span>The Scent of Rain and Lightning.&nbsp;</span><span>Logan Miller also has a side career as a musician.&nbsp;He has also directed, produced and starred in a number of his own short films, some of which he has uploaded to popular streaming platform YouTube.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Movies and TV Shows</span></strong></h2><p><span>Logan Miller has been in the
