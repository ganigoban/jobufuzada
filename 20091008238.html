Although he won a place at the prestigious London School of Economics, fame came calling with the blues band he started up with Keith Richards (together they are known as the Glimmer Twins), Brian Jones, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Rolling Stones</h2><p id=e8OjlQKKUg data-wc=73>The Rolling Stones quickly gained a rougher and sexier reputation than their contemporaries, the Beatles, in Sixties swinging London, with stories of goings-on that even today's rock stars would have problems keeping up with. Due to difficulties with guitarist Brian Jones, Jagger formed a close writing relationship with bandmate Keith, and as Brian left the band in 1969, The Stones only rocketed to become the "Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World".</p><p id=eJyV4JO7bm data-wc=27>As frontman and lead singer of The Rolling Stones, Mick shaped what it meant to be a bona fide rock god with his impressive flamboyant stage presence.</p><p id=eVQ2vIGNBR data-wc=33>Despite all members of the band grappling with drug use, and a few lineup changes, they have produced almost 30 albums, as in 2023 they released the album to critical acclaim.</p><p id=ePr-qVkQ2LA data-wc=63>Although the singer said that he would not be rockin' and rollin' beyond his 33rd year, the band are still touring today as Mick, Keith, and Ronnie Woods who joined the band in the 70s. In fact, their Bigger Bang tour saw them listed in the Guinness Book of World Records after they earned a staggering $437 million from the string of gigs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mick Jagger's personal life</h2><p id=e5TqQBrcsM data-wc=75>Throughout his four decades of fame, Mick has been linked with some of the most beautiful women in the world and has seven children by four. Marianne Faithfull; Bianca Rose Perez Moreno de Macias, whom he made Mrs Jagger in 1971, five months before she gave birth to Jade; Marsha Hunt (they have a daughter, Karis); Jerry Hall, mother of four of his children; Carla Bruni and Luciana Morad (lovechild Lucas was born in 1999).&nbsp;</p><p id=eP-OU9Sy38 data-wc=23>Many society girls, including Catherine Guinness and Cornelia Guest, as well as models and even actress Uma Thurman have been linked with him.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFcIroeIWC data-wc=58>When Luciana revealed she was pregnant by Mick, it proved the final straw for Jerry Hall and she filed for divorce. Mick's claim that their 1991 Hindu wedding ceremony was not legally binding as a marriage struck a sour note, but the rocker, who is notoriously careful with his money, did finally reach an eight-figure settlement with Jerry.&nbsp;</p><p id=eosOUmorVA data-wc=137>By the start of the new millenium it seemed as though Mick was ready to settle down again, though - this time with statuesque 6ft 4in former model L'Wren Scott, who he describes as his "main point of interest". When L'Wren died after a long period of depression, Mick made it clear he was devastated, releasing a statement that said: "I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me. I have been touched by the tributes that people have paid to her, and also the personal messages of support that I have received. I will never forget her."</p><p id=eBmxB8Kl0_ data-wc=20>Not long after, he revealed a relationship with Melanie Hamrick, a former ballerina. The couple welcomed a child in 2016.</p><p id=eGKaZ_k8ah data-wc=38>Mick accepted a knighthood in 2003 and on December 12 was knighted by the Prince of Wales. This move caused uproar among some of his fans, however, who were disappointed he'd chosen to contradict his famous anti-establishment stance.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKAHSMSdK0 data-wc=8><a class=hm-link href=#>Click here for more information on Mick Jagger.</a></p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ra2hkuqqvymahmp%2BXmr9w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20091008238.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./millie-jackson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./millie-jackson.html>Millie Jackson, Freelance Writer - HELLO!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./spring-lemon-risotto-asparagus-peas.html>Lemon Risotto with Asparagus &amp;amp; Peas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./spring-lemon-risotto-asparagus-peas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
