She is known professionally as Alicia Keys. Keys is the only child of her mother Teresa Augello, and one of three children of her father Craig Cook. Her father left when she was two years old, leaving her mother to raise her as a single parent in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City.She began singing from an early age, performing in school musical productions as early as preschool. After a friend gifted Keys an old piano, she began taking lessons as a child. By the time she was seven years old, she was receiving classical piano training. She would continue her studies of classical music until age 18. Furthermore, she enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School when she was twelve, where she took classes in music, dance, theater, and choir.Keys continued her education, graduating early from high school at the age of 16 as valedictorian. She then attended Columbia University on scholarship. After struggling to balance the demanding schedule of her university course load in addition to working in the recording studio, she decided to drop out of college after a month to focus on music full-time. However, she was extremely frustrated with the lack of control she had over her music, as Columbia tried to create a certain image for her and force her to work with producers she did not like. Eventually, with the help of Robinson and the president of Arista Records, Clive Davis, Keys negotiated out of her Columbia contract and signed with Arista in late 1998. After Davis was ousted from Arista in 2000, her album was once again put on hold, but he started his label, J Records, and immediately signed her to it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Alicia Keys have?</h2><p>In 2013 Alicia and Swizz paid $10.4 million for an enormous mansion in the town of Englewood, New Jersey.
